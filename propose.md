Product Name	Falcon PMS — Performance Management System
Prepared by	Falcon Consulting — Systems Development Team
Target Clients	SMEs, NGOs, Corporates, Public Sector, Falcon itself
Document Version	v2.0 — Detailed Commercial Proposal
Date	February 2025




 
1. Executive Summary
Falcon Consulting is developing a cloud-based, multi-tenant Performance Management System (PMS) — a SaaS platform that can be licensed to any organisation, regardless of sector, size, or geography. The platform enables organisations to plan, track, review, and report on performance in one unified system, replacing fragmented Excel sheets and manual processes with a professional, automated solution.

This proposal covers the full scope of the system as it has evolved from initial conversations about KPI tracking for CMD Centre, through the Falcon strategy execution framework, and into a commercially viable SaaS product. It incorporates all requirements from the System Specifications document, the Falcon meeting transcripts, and additional requirements raised — including multi-sector KPI frameworks, the Dashboard Champion model, data validation and approval workflows, automated notifications, company-level target cascading, and Falcon's own use of the system as a client.

Product Positioning Statement
Falcon PMS is a configurable, cloud-based performance management platform that helps organisations of any type — commercial, NGO, or public sector — align people, goals, and results through automated planning, tracking, reviews, and real-time insights. One platform. Every sector. Every size.


2. The Problem Being Solved
Organisations across all sectors — commercial companies, NGOs, government agencies, and consulting firms — share a common challenge: they invest significant effort in strategic planning at the beginning of the year, but then struggle to track whether that plan is being executed. The most common symptoms are:

•	Performance data lives in multiple disconnected Excel files that are time-consuming to update and impossible to view in real time.
•	There is no automated calculation of performance scores — managers manually calculate percentages and apply traffic-light colors.
•	Year-end reporting is a crisis — weeks are spent manually compiling 12 months of data per person.
•	Staff self-report their own performance figures, creating a risk of inflated or inaccurate data.
•	There is no structured accountability tool — no mission status report, no formal review workflow.
•	Different types of organisations measure success differently — an NGO measures impact and beneficiaries while a commercial firm measures revenue and margins — and no single system accommodates both without customization.


3. The Proposed Solution — Falcon PMS
3.1 What It Is
Falcon PMS is a web-based SaaS platform accessible from any browser on any device. Each client organisation gets their own secure, independently configured environment — their own URL, branding, users, and data — completely isolated from all other clients on the platform. Falcon itself can also be a client of the system, using it to manage its own internal performance.

The system is built around three fundamental layers:

Layer	Who Uses It	What It Does
Falcon Admin (Super Admin)	Falcon Consulting team	Manage all client organisations, subscriptions, billing, system configuration, technical oversight
Organisation Dashboard	Each client's HR/IT admin	Configure their organisation — users, departments, KPI frameworks, branding, review cycles, Dashboard Champion
Individual User Dashboard	Every staff member	View own KPIs, enter data (subject to approval), complete reviews, write mission status reports, manage tasks


3.2 Multi-Sector Flexibility — Different Measures for Different Organisations
A core design principle of Falcon PMS is that it accommodates different types of organisations without requiring custom development for each. The way performance is measured differs by sector — and the system handles all of them:

Sector	How They Measure Success	Examples in the System
Commercial / Corporate	Financial results, sales targets, margins, market share	Revenue vs target, % budget variance, cost savings, headcount
NGO / Non-Profit	Impact indicators, beneficiaries reached, donor metrics	People trained, communities reached, % grant utilized, policy documents produced
Public Sector	Service delivery, compliance, citizen outcomes	Turnaround times, compliance rates, permits issued, public satisfaction scores
Consulting (e.g. Falcon)	Client deliverables, project milestones, utilization	Projects completed, client satisfaction, billable hours, strategy sessions delivered

Every KPI in the system is tagged with its measure type, calculation logic, and sector context — so the same platform works for a hospital, an NGO, a bank, and a consulting firm simultaneously, each seeing their own sector-appropriate framework.


3.3 KPI Types & Smart Calculation Engine
The system supports the following KPI data types, accommodating both quantitative and qualitative performance tracking:

KPI Type	Used For	How It's Measured
Count / Number	Activities, outputs	Actual number vs target number (e.g. 47 meetings vs target of 60)
Percentage (%)	Rates, compliance, utilization	Actual % vs target % (e.g. 85% budget utilized vs 100% target)
Financial Amount	Revenue, costs, grants, savings	Actual amount vs target amount; logic depends on direction
Yes / No Milestone	Documents, policies, events	Binary — done or not done (e.g. strategic plan approved: Yes/No)
Time / Turnaround	Processing times, response times	Actual time vs target time (e.g. 48hr invoice processing)
Impact Score	NGO outcomes, satisfaction, engagement	Scaled or rated score vs target (e.g. beneficiary satisfaction: 4.2/5)

Calculation Logic — Two Formulas
For every numeric KPI, the system administrator configures one of two calculation directions:

Logic Type	Formula	When to Use	Example
Higher is Better	Actual ÷ Target × 100	Revenue, training, beneficiaries	Revenue 989M / Target 1B = 98%
Lower is Better	Target ÷ Actual × 100	Costs, penalties, debt, errors	Debtors: Target 20M / Actual 32M = 62%

Cumulative vs Non-Cumulative Measures
•	Cumulative measures (e.g. revenue, beneficiaries) — monthly actuals are added together to give a year-to-date total compared against the cumulative target.
•	Non-cumulative measures (e.g. employee engagement score, system uptime) — only the most recent month's actual is compared against that month's target. Previous months are not added.

Traffic Light Status — Automated
Status	Score Range	Action Required
🟢  On Track	90% and above	Monitor and sustain
🟡  At Risk	50% – 89%	Review and intervene
🔴  Off Track	Below 50%	Escalate and remediate


3.4 Phasing of Measures — Monthly Target Setting
At the start of each performance cycle (typically annual), every KPI's annual target is phased — split across the 12 months to reflect realistic seasonal patterns and organizational planning cycles. For example, a revenue target of KES 15 billion is not simply divided by 12; it is distributed according to expected business seasonality.

Once phased, monthly targets are locked and cannot be changed. This is critical for data integrity. Only actual performance figures are updated each month — against these locked targets. The phasing process happens in a guided setup wizard before the performance cycle begins.


3.5 Data Entry, Supervisor Validation & The Dashboard Champion
The system separates three distinct responsibilities to ensure data integrity, accountability, and strategic oversight. These three roles work together in a structured workflow:

How Data Entry & Validation Works
Step 1: Staff member enters their monthly actual figures into the system. The entry is flagged as 'Pending Validation' — it does NOT yet appear on any dashboard or report. Step 2: The staff member's direct Supervisor receives a notification to review the submitted figures. Step 3: The Supervisor approves or rejects the entry with written comments. If rejected, the staff member is notified and must resubmit. Step 4: Only Supervisor-approved data goes live on dashboards and is included in reports. This ensures the person closest to the work — the supervisor — is the one validating its accuracy.

The Dashboard Champion plays a separate and distinct role from validation. Their responsibilities are at the organizational level — not individual entry approval:
•	Enter the organization’s company-wide annual targets into the system at the start of each performance cycle
•	Phase (split) those company targets across 12 months and lock them before the cycle begins
•	Cascade company targets down to department level and then to individual staff members
•	Monitor aggregate performance — tracking how individual contributions add up to departmental and company totals
•	Ensure all staff have submitted their monthly entries and follow up on outstanding data
•	Produce organisation-level performance summaries for leadership and board review

This separation of duties is intentional and important: the Supervisor validates the accuracy of their team's data, while the Dashboard Champion ensures the integrity and completeness of the organisation's overall performance picture.


3.6 Automated Notifications
The system sends automated notifications to keep everyone accountable. Key notification triggers include:

Notification Trigger	Who Gets Notified	Timing
Monthly data not entered by 5th of month	Staff member + their supervisor	5th of every month
Data submitted but not yet approved	Supervisor	Immediately on submission
KPI entry rejected by Supervisor	Staff member	Immediately on rejection
Performance review due	Staff + supervisor	3 days before due date
Approval workflow pending >48 hours	Supervisor + HR Admin	48 hours after submission
KPI is Red status for 2+ months	Supervisor + HR Admin	After second consecutive red month
PIP timeline expiring	Manager + HR Admin	7 days before expiry
Subscription renewal due	Client Account Admin + Falcon Admin	30 days before expiry


4. User Roles & Access Control
The system is built on a role-based access control (RBAC) model. Every user is assigned one or more roles, and roles determine exactly what they can see, enter, approve, and manage. Roles are configurable per organisation — so a small NGO might only use three roles while a large corporate might use all seven.

Role	Key Permissions	Typical User in CMD / Commercial Org
Super Admin (Falcon)	Manage all client orgs, subscriptions, billing, technical config	Falcon Consulting admin team
Client Account Admin	Configure org settings, branding, review cycles, modules, user management	HR Director or IT Manager
Dashboard Champion	Enter company-wide annual targets, phase & lock targets, cascade to departments & individuals, monitor aggregate performance, track submission compliance	Finance Manager or IT Officer
Executive / Senior Management	View all dashboards (full org), approve selected workflows, view strategic reports	CEO, Director, Board Member
Line Manager / Supervisor	View own + direct reports' dashboards, give feedback, conduct appraisals, approve plans, initiate PIPs	Head of Department, Team Lead
Staff / Employee	View own dashboard, enter data (pending validation), complete self-assessments, manage own tasks	All staff members
Read-Only (e.g. Donor / Auditor)	View selected dashboards and reports only — no data entry or approval rights	Donor representative, external auditor

5.4 Hierarchical Dashboard Viewing — Supervisor Sees Their Entire Team
A core feature of the system is that when a supervisor logs in, their dashboard does not just show their own KPIs — it gives them a complete, real-time view of every person who reports to them. This is the accountability engine that makes the system genuinely useful for management.

How the Supervisor Dashboard Works
When a supervisor logs in they see: (1) Their own KPI dashboard at the top — personal measures, progress bars, and traffic-light status. (2) Directly below, a Team Section showing every staff member who reports to them — each displayed as a card with name, role, and a mini summary of their KPI traffic-light status. (3) The supervisor clicks any team member card and instantly sees that person's full dashboard — all KPIs, monthly actuals, progress scores, and traffic lights. (4) If that team member is also a supervisor, clicking continues down the reporting chain with no limit on depth. At any point, a supervisor has full real-time visibility of their team without asking for a single report.

•	Own dashboard first — the supervisor always sees their own KPIs at the top
•	Team overview panel — all direct reports shown as cards with name, role, overall performance score, and traffic-light status (Green / Amber / Red)
•	Click-through to any team member's full dashboard — all their KPIs, monthly targets, actuals, and progress in full detail
•	Drill down the hierarchy — if a direct report manages their own team, click through to see that team too, all the way down
•	Team performance summary — aggregate showing how many of the supervisor's team are On Track, At Risk, or Off Track
•	Pending validation alerts — supervisor sees at a glance who has submitted data awaiting their approval
•	Missing data alerts — supervisor sees who has NOT entered monthly data after the 5th of each month
•	Executive view — a CEO or Director logging in sees all Heads of Department and can drill through the entire organisation from one screen
•	No limit on hierarchy depth — works equally for a team of 3 or an organisation of 3,000
•	Read-Only access for donors and auditors — granted access to specific dashboards or reports only
•	Falcon Admin — can view any client organization’s dashboard for support and quality assurance

6. Falcon as a Client of Its Own System
A key strategic decision is that Falcon Consulting should itself be an active client of the Falcon PMS. This is both a credibility statement to potential buyers and a practical internal management tool. Falcon's own team performance — strategy sessions delivered, client satisfaction scores, project milestones, billable hours, and internal KPIs — will be tracked on the same platform that is sold to clients.

Why This Matters
When Falcon goes to a client and says 'we use this system ourselves to run our business', it is the most powerful sales tool possible. It means Falcon has skin in the game — the system is not just a product Falcon sells; it is a product Falcon depends on. This builds trust and credibility in a way that no brochure or demo can match.

Falcon's account will be configured as a showcase client — with best-practice KPI frameworks for a consulting firm visible to prospects during sales demos. The Falcon instance will have its own sector-specific measures (consulting KPIs) demonstrating the system's flexibility.


7. Phased Delivery Plan
The system will be built and delivered in five phases. Each phase produces a usable, deployable product. Falcon can begin selling Phase 1 immediately while Phase 2 is being built.

Phase	Name	Features Delivered	Est. Timeline
1	Core Platform	Multi-tenant architecture, login & hierarchy, KPI management, phasing wizard, smart calculations, traffic lights, Supervisor validation workflow + Dashboard Champion target management, automated notifications (5th of month), basic reports, client branding	Month 1–2
2	Reviews & Tasks	Self-assessment & supervisor review workflows, mission status report, tasks & dependencies module, evidence uploads, mid-year & end-year appraisals, PIP module	Month 2–3
3	Analytics & Export	Executive dashboards, departmental heat maps, trend analysis, PDF/Excel/CSV export, PowerPoint mission plan export, compliance reports, full notification system	Month 3
4	Commercial Layer	Subscription & billing management, free trial setup, invoice generation, feature tiers, Falcon Admin commercial dashboard, renewal alerts	Month 3–4
5	Advanced Features	360-degree feedback, competency management, learning & development module, ERP/HRIS integrations, Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace SSO, Power BI connector, mobile app	Month 4+


8. Technical Architecture
8.1 Technology Stack
Layer	Technology	Why
Frontend	HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (React or Vue)	Fast, browser-based, works on any device
Backend / API	Node.js or Python (Django/FastAPI)	Scalable, secure, handles multi-tenant logic
Database	PostgreSQL (relational)	Structured data, multi-tenant row-level security
Authentication	JWT tokens + optional SSO	Secure login, role-based access, 2FA support
Hosting	AWS / Google Cloud / Azure	24/7 availability, scalable, disaster recovery
Notifications	Email (SendGrid) + in-app alerts	Reliable delivery, trackable, branded
File Storage	AWS S3 or equivalent	Secure evidence and document storage

8.2 Multi-Tenant Architecture
The system uses a shared infrastructure, isolated data model — meaning all clients share the same application and database infrastructure, but each client's data is completely separated using tenant IDs and row-level security. No client can ever see another client's data. This is the same architecture used by platforms like Salesforce, Workday, and HubSpot.

8.3 Security
•	Encrypted data in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (AES-256)
•	Role-based access control — users only see what their role permits
•	Two-factor authentication (2FA) available for all users
•	Session timeout and access logging
•	Full audit trail — every action timestamped with user identity
•	GDPR and local data protection compliance


•	client.


9. Risks & Mitigation
Risk	Likelihood	Mitigation Strategy
Staff resistance to adopting the system	Medium	Simple, intuitive UI; phased rollout; training per phase; Falcon support during onboarding
Poor data quality (garbage in, garbage out)	High	Supervisor validation model; data only goes live after supervisor approval; audit trail for all entries
Scope creep extending timelines	Medium	Strict phase-based delivery; new requirements go to future phases; sprint-based reviews
Different sectors need very different features	Medium	Configurable modules — clients enable only what they need; sector-specific KPI templates built in
Data security and client confidentiality	High	Multi-tenant isolation; encryption; role-based access; GDPR compliance; regular security audits
Internet connectivity in some client locations	Low-Medium	Progressive web app design; offline data entry with sync when connected



10. Conclusion
Falcon PMS is not a single-client dashboard — it is a commercially scalable, multi-sector performance management platform that Falcon Consulting can sell, operate, and grow as a standalone SaaS business. Every feature described in this proposal is technically achievable and has been designed around real requirements from real organisations.

The system accommodates NGOs tracking social impact, commercial firms tracking financial results, public sector organisations tracking service delivery, and consulting firms tracking their own performance — all on the same platform, each in their own secure environment. It handles the full performance management lifecycle: from goal setting and target phasing, through continuous tracking with validation, to formal reviews, mission status reports, and auto-generated analytics.
